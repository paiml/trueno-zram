# SC2247: Multiplying strings doesn't work in shell
# Justification: False positive - this is Python code inside heredoc (Issue #120)
# File: scripts/test-swap-deadlock.sh line 105

# SEC001: Command injection risk via eval
# Justification: Intentional use for dynamic test function dispatch
# File: scripts/falsification-runner.sh - test runner pattern
# Manual review: COMPLETED - eval only uses function names from controlled array

# SEC010: Path traversal risk
# Justification: All paths are controlled within the script:
#   - RESULTS_DIR: Set from env or defaults to /workspace/test-results
#   - write_file/read_file: Created via mktemp (secure random)
#   - /mnt/test: Fixed path for test mount point
# Manual review: COMPLETED - no user-controlled paths used
