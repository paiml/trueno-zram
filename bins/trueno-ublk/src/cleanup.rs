//! Cleanup module - Orphan device detection and graceful shutdown
//!
//! Per DT-003: Implements signal handlers and startup orphan cleanup to prevent
//! stale ublk device state that causes I/O errors (see F083 root cause analysis).
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Detects orphaned ublk character devices on startup (via duende-ublk)
//! - Cleans up orphaned devices before creating new ones
//! - Provides graceful shutdown via SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
